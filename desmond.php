			<h2>Computer Science</h2>
            <p>Before coming to the University of Rochester, I have taught myself programming languages using online resources. Eventually, during my senior year, I decided to take a formal course in Computer Science by taking AP Computer Science A where I learned to use Java, and competed in several hackathons. Through my participation in these hackathons, I realized that I can use my computer science abilities to create a better future, and I ended up majoring Computer Science to improve my knowledge in this field.</p>

			<h2>Digital Media Studies</h2>
			<p>As I knew how to use certain tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Premiere before taking any Digital Media courses, I decided to improve upon these abilities when I came to college. After taking several courses in Digital Media improve my abilities with these tools, and I found that these skills apply towards many other fields. </p>
