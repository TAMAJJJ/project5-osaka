			<h2>Computer Science</h2>
            <p>Before coming to the University of Rochester, I have taught myself programming languages using online resources. Eventually, during my senior year, I decided to take a formal course in Computer Science by taking AP Computer Science A where I learned to use Java, and competed in several hackathons. Through my participation in these hackathons, I realized that I can use my computer science abilities to create a better future, and I ended up majoring Computer Science to improve my knowledge in this field. Currently, I am familiar with C#, Python, Java, Kotlin, C, and Javascript.</p>

			<h2>Digital Media Studies</h2>
			<p>As I knew how to use certain tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Premiere before taking any Digital Media courses, I decided to improve upon these abilities when I came to college. After taking several courses in Digital Media improve my abilities with these tools, and I found that these skills apply towards many other fields. </p>

            <h2>SASE</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am the Fundraising Chair of the University of Rochester Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers. As the Fundraising Chair, I am responsible for organizing fundraisers through communicating with various offices and businesses to create a successful fundraiser. My role as the Fundraising Chair is important to the club because it is the primary means of funding the club's events.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>I worked on many different projects over the past several years. Some of these projects include creating games for hackathons, creating a motion tracker for a research project, and even a prototype social media website. Some of these can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/KarmaPanda">GitHub</a>.</p>
