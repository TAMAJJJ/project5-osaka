			<h2>Computer Science</h2>
			<p>
                I didn't have any experience with computer science going into college, and decided to major in it
                only because I thought it might be interesting. I now have experience coding with languages such as
                python and Java. While I have experience coding in various languages, I’m particularly interested in
                web design and front-end web development. So far, I have HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, JQuery,
                Bootstrap, and SQL under my belt, and I’m always trying to learn new programming languages,
                frameworks, or other principles I can integrate into my projects.

            </p>

			<h2>Digital Media Studies</h2>
			<p>
                I decided I wanted to major in digital media studies because I've always been interested in digital art
                and loved things that were aesthetically pleasing. Digital media studies is also a very flexible major
                that can be used in many different fields. Knowing how to navigate and manage media is especially a
                useful skill for me while working on designing and creating websites.

			<h2>High School Projects and Areas of Study</h2>
            <p>
                My passion for digital art began 6 years ago, when I started learning Adobe Illustrator back in New
                Jersey. I enjoyed sketching as a kid and liked to design interesting creatures or monsters.
                Doing something similar on a digital screen felt even easier and less time consuming. I have over
                6 years of experience with digital art and graphic design and am proficient using Illustrator,
                Photoshop, and Adobe XD.
