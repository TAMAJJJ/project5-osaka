			<h2>At the University of Rochester</h2>
			<h3>Computer Science</h3>
			<p>
            Until end of the sophomore year, I was majoring in business only because that was what majority of my
            friends majored in. However, when I saw my friend did a project for CSC210, the whole final product compelled my 
            interest. I am a person who need to see visual and tangible result but studying business never could fulfill
            my desire. But I knew coding would give me explicit product and this is how I started to change my major 
            to Computer Science.

			<h3 class="extra_space">Digital Media Studies</h3>
			<p>
            Taking photo and videos of beautiful scenery was always one of
            my best hobby which eventuall made me want to learn more about
            what types of techniques are out in real industry and what has
            improved as time goes. Fortunately enough, University of Rochester offers various media study courses and I was more than happy to take courses.

			<h2>High School Projects and Areas of Study</h2>
            <p>
            The most interesting subject I learned in highschool is chemistry. The fact that everything is composed of atoms was mind blowing. 
            Also, if you have enough knowledge about chemistry, it provides an excellent basis for understanding the physical universe we live in.
            In my class, we didn't do any project but labs which made me completely lose track of time.
