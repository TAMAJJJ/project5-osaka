			<h2>At the University of Rochester</h2>
			<h3>Computer Science</h3>
					<p>
						I knew only a little bit of Java coming out of high school and decided to to improve the situation with an intro programming class. Especially interesting to me was the way complex programs have an exact way of fitting together, piece by piece. After another year, I decided to persue a minor and gained experience with versatile programs I may not have ever used otherwise.

						I decided to take a film class when I went to the UofR and quickly signed up for several the following year. After two years, I realized that constructing and deconstructing video was something I loved to do. I decided to major in the production track.

			<h3 class="extra_space">Clubs and Organization</h3>
				<p>I was a member of the Equestrian Club for two years. Riding horses was something I had wanted to do since I was young, and with fundraisers and weekly group lessons, we were able to take lessons, compete, and help care for horses at a fraction of the regular cost. I learned a great deal about how to care for farm animals and how to coordinate (often nonverbally) with other riders, the instructor, and the horses.</p>

			<h2>High School Projects and Areas of Study</h2>
					<p>
						After a few brief explorations of Golden Age film history (courtesy of essays in my high school English department), I discovered that the limitations and unique communication style of digital art make it interesting to create and deconstruct. In a group of three, I helped to screenwrite, shoot, and edit a short, psychological thriller which we screened in a high school film class.
