## *List of what and where was changed*
 + Navigation animation added
 + Student list is now in F-Pattern
 + Added a link on Osaka logo that goes back to index page
 + 

## *Where Design Principle was applied*
 + Proximity principle is applied to each header and following paragraph
 + Contrast principle (size) is applied to main heading and sub heading
 + Alignment principle is applied to every page
 + Repetition principle is applied to indivisual student pages, they are strunctured in the same way to indicate they share similar properties/contents
 + Added navigation animation in order to minimalize the distraction when the user is not looking at it.
 + Background image brings to mind Computer Science (through monospace, white text on a dark background, and charts) and also humans (through the little figures).
 + Changed type faces to primarily Slab Serifs (and to related, Google-Fonts-recommended typefaces such as Montserrat). The key
 was to evoke a fun, stylized, and "artsy" tone to match the Digital Media Focus- while still mixing it with a clean, yet humanized type face to evoke Computer Science.

## *Where Design Principle was applied*
 + Proximity principle is applied to each header and following paragraph. Different sets of information (whether people on the student list or subjects on the personal pages) are clearly separated. The structure of the document is easy to process.
 + Contrast principle (size) is applied to main heading and each level of sub heading for readability and hierarchy. Links separate themselves from the rest of the page and push the user to action.
 + Alignment principle is applied across each student row in the F-Frame (for intuitive grouping to that particular student) and beneath each h2 on the personal pages (to implicitly group those subheadings under the h2).
 + Repetition principle is applied to individual student pages. They are structured in the same way to indicate they share similar properties and content.
 + Article and aside on the personal pages apply (an adjusted approximation of) the Golden Ratio and rule of thirds. F-Frame applies rule of thirds for aesthetic value.
