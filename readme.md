## *Classes and Relationships*

We organized our information based on categories we all had in common and arranged them in the same way on each webpage to create a uniform look. Each of the students had a major, which we displayed at the top of the page under our names. We grouped the information of each webpage into two main categories: pre-college interests and college education. We put the college education in the article because it is the central section of the webpage while the pre-college interests were placed in the aside. The group had projects related to our interests, which were linked in the aside as well. One thing all of us had in common was an interest or education in both computer science and digital media studies. All of the students took classes related to computer science and digital media and had experience in different coding languages and software. The group also realized that everyone was involved in a club or organization on campus and included a description of the organization under the Computer Science and Digital Media Studies subheadings. 

## *Choreography*

We decided to use a few different framework to organize our site, making use of the classes we had established. These included (from broadest to most specific):

+ Alphabetical (ascending from A to Z)
+ Time (reverse-chronological)
+ Hierarchy (in terms of which subjects this project directly fell under)
+ Categorical (within the academic areas, what we had learned)

We organized our webpages by in alphabetical order. Initially, we considered placing them in reverse order of graduation (to reflect the reverse-chronological structure within each page)- but quickly realized that 2/3 of the group was graduating at the same time. Since there was no relevant location, time, category, or hierarchy to look at, we put the pages in alphabetical order. The intention was to give the list structure, but also to leave it relatively arbitrary.

The structure and order of each page was dictated by our website's focus. Each of us had written in Project 1 about our current interests at the U of R, with a sidebar on how we were introduced to our current interests (and related projects we did) in high school. Since the main focus was our current status, we made that the most prominent section. By putting it on the left, we also placed it where (if reading left-to-right) a viewer would read it first. The short blurb on what we did in HS became the aside, along with a related, external link to past and current projects which were tangentially related to the focus of the site (on the academics themselves).

Within the main article, the subheadings (Computer Science, Digital Media Studies, and Clubs & Organizations) were organized categorically. To an extent, they were also listed in hierarchy of what subjects, on a meta level, this project itself fell under. As a CSC project with a distinct digital design element, we listed Computer Science first.

We organized each of those subsections (within each subject) by category. We included a short summary of our reasons for taking part in each area for all three, and as an introduction, we listed it first. Where applicable, we included a list of classes/particular computer programs in which we were experienced.
