## *List of what and where was changed*
 + Navigation bar is simplified. Provides little distraction from the Call to Action in the Strong Fallow Area while guiding eyeline to the login.
 + Added navigation animation in order to minimalize the distraction when the user is not looking at it.
 + Student list is added and styled in an F-Pattern for ease of scanning and focus on the Call to Action (link to personal page).
 + Added a link on Osaka logo that goes back to index page so that navigation to the index is easy.
 + Calls to Action are stylized to appear prominent and to be responsive. Give an intuitive understanding of what they do and encourage the user to click.
 + Background image brings to mind Computer Science (through monospace, white text on a dark background, and charts) and also humans (through the little figures).
 + Student images look uniform to avoid confusion.
 + The article and asides on the invidual pages are styled the same way to clarify that they are the same type of information.
 + Grid-gap is widened to show distinction between columns.
 + Majors confined to one line of text for uniformity.
 + Changed type faces to primarily Slab Serifs (and to related, Google-Fonts-recommended typefaces such as Montserrat). The key
 was to evoke a fun, stylized, and "artsy" tone to match the Digital Media Focus- while still mixing it with a clean, yet humanized type face to evoke Computer Science.

## *Where Design Principle was applied*
 + Proximity principle is applied to each header and following paragraph. Different sets of information (whether people on the student list or subjects on the personal pages) are clearly separated. The structure of the document is easy to process.
 + Contrast principle (size) is applied to main heading and each level of sub heading for readability and hierarchy. 
 + H2s contrast in typeface, size, and (slightly) in alignment for ease of finding each section's beginning.
 + Links contrast heavily against the background (in color, font, and behavior) in order to separate themselves from the rest of the page and push the user to action.
 + Alignment principle is applied across each student row in the F-Frame (for intuitive grouping to that particular student) and beneath each h2 on the personal pages (to implicitly group those subheadings under the h2).
 + The index's columns are aligned to show a relationship in subject matter.
 + Repetition principle is applied to individual student pages. They are structured in the same way to indicate they share similar properties and content- you know where each section is located.
 + Article and aside on the personal pages apply (an approximation of) the Golden Ratio and rule of thirds. F-Frame applies rule of thirds.
