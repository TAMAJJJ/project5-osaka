## *Classes and Relationships*


## *Choreography*

We decided to use a few different framework to organize our site, making use of the classes we had established. These included (from broadest to most specific):

+ Alphabetical (ascending from A to Z)
+ Time (reverse-chronological)
+ Hierarchy (in terms of which subjects this project directly fell under)
+ Categorical (within the academic areas, what we had learned)

We organized our webpages by in alphabetical order. Initially, we considered placing them in reverse order of graduation (to reflect the reverse-chronological structure within each page)- but quickly realized that 2/3 of the group was graduating at the same time. Since there was no relevant location, time, category, or hierarchy to look at, we put the pages in alphabetical order. The intention was to give the list structure, but also to leave it relatively arbitrary.

The structure and order of each page was dictated by our website's focus. Each of us had written in Project 1 about our current interests at the U of R, with a sidebar on how we were introduced to our current interests (and related projects we did) in high school. Since the main focus was our current status, we made that the most prominent section. By putting it on the left, we also placed it where (if reading left-to-right) a viewer would read it first. The short blurb on what we did in HS became the aside, along with a related, external link to past and current projects which were tangentially related to the focus of the site (on the academics themselves).

Within the main article, the subheadings (Computer Science, Digital Media Studies, and Clubs & Organizations) were organized categorically. To an extent, they were also listed in hierarchy of what subjects, on a meta level, this project itself fell under. As a CSC project with a distinct digital design element, we listed Computer Science first.

We organized each of those subsections (within each subject) by category. We included a short summary of our reasons for taking part in each area for all three, and as an introduction, we listed it first. Where applicable, we included a list of classes/particular computer programs in which we were experienced.
